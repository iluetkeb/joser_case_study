\begin{abstract}
An abstract should be a concise summary of the
significant items in the paper, including the results and
conclusions. It should be not more than about 500 words. Define all nonstandard symbols,
abbreviations and acronyms used in the abstract. Do not cite
references in the abstract.

A list of significant keywords (2 minimum, 5 recommended) should
be included in the first page of each submitted paper. Keywords
must be chosen from those predefined within the IEEE RAS subject
areas (\url{http://www.ieee-ras.org/uploads/tro/T-RO\_Keywords.pdf}) or
the IEEE CS subject area
(\url{http://www.computer.org/portal/pages/ieeecs/publications/author/keywords/ACMtaxonomy.html}).

\IEEEPARstart{T}{he} {\sl section on Case Studies and Experience Reports} of the Journal 
of Software Engineering for Robotics (JOSER) is dedicated to reporting
experiences from building real-world robot software systems. The primary
focus is to report experiences about the effectiveness of software 
engineering approaches and methods. A secondary focus is on reporting
general issues and problems with software engineering in robotics, 
particularly but not only for novel application domains (of which robotics
has many).

Papers for this section are fairly short (4 pages). Therefore,
while the relevant topics for this section are generally the same as for JOSER
overall, we would expect that the methods applied are not novel,
but that the focus is on case studies applying existing concepts and tools, and
reporting their experiences with them. In particular, we encourage reports on
\begin{itemize}
\item Reports \emph{confirming} the (degree of) suitability of particular method and/or concept
\item Reports \emph{identifying} a specific gap in existing methods/concepts
\item Reports \emph{stimulating} general investigation of novel methods because of unsolved issues
\end{itemize}

General information on preparing papers for JOSER can be found in~\cite{JOSER:Brugali}. The 
online version of this document, with \LaTeX{} sources, can be found at \url{https://github.com/iluetkeb/joser_case_study}. The original \LaTeX{} document for IEEE CS journals by Michael
Shell might also be useful, see \url{http://www.michaelshell.org/tex/ieeetran/}.

The remainder of this document, starting with the Introduction section, \textbf{defines a common
structure for case study papers}. It is based upon general guidelines for reporting of case 
studies, by Runeson and Höst~\cite{ESE2009:Runeson}. Please stick to this structure
as much as possible, to make case study papers more accessible.
